# Inspiration
The idea for LIFETIMES_ came to us quite literally in our dreams. We often chase our dreams from time to time because they hold stories and feelings from our most creative imaginations - thus, each experience is its own "lifetime." Recording our dreams right after waking deepens our connection with the subconscious, which can grow over weeks, months, and even years. We wanted to slash the burden of "dream journalling" by utilizing artificial intelligence to delegate monotonous organizational tasks.

# What it does
LIFETIMES_ is a dream analytics and social wellness application bridging our spiritual and physical experiences. Looking inward into our dreams, we seek meaningful insights and habits while mentally exercising our ability to recollect actions from our sleep. The application allows users to recite their dreams and view those of their peers, while Perplexity's AI models detect dreaming trends and patterns that provide mindful guidance for improving their subconscious and emotional well-being.

# How we built it
We built LIFETIMES_ as a web application with the React/NextJS framework. The backend utilizes Python with FastAPI to handle communication with MongoDB for storage of complex information and Perplexity AI for deep insightful analysis via REST API calls. The front-end is built on Typescript and TailwindCSS, utilizing Auth0 to expound on MongoDB for security and user verification.

# Challenges we ran into
We are incredibly proud of how LIFETIMES_ turned out, though it certainly came with its set of challenges. Prioritizing fast development languages like Python over Java was certainly a learning curve, but it proved beneficial for housing API endpoints and calls. On the other hand, we wrote the front-end with TypeScript to enforce type-safe practices and assurance of program integrity. Apart from the tech stack, the team worked exceptionally well together, and lots of fun memories were made!

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were incredibly proud to implement so many technologies together in a functional way, primarily spearheaded by MongoDB's housing of all integral information. Apart from that, micro-animations and interactability were certainly unique achievements that made all the effort worth it.

# What we learned
The most important takeaway was how to structure a project around MongoDB's NoSQL system and how to take advantage of its horizontally expanding capabilities. We got carried away with adding additional functionalities because of this, but it was fantastic to explore options in an otherwise stagnant selection of storage systems.

# What's next for LIFETIMES_
Our first and foremost goal would be to expand the field of the application into mobile devices. We want to make LIFETIMES_ an application that will follow you for your lifetime and thus accessibility and ease of use is a top priority. In the same vein, another feature we plan to implement would be speech-to-text for logging dreams.
